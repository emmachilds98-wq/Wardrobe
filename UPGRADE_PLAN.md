# Dave's Wardrobe: review and upgrade plan

The live version is the claude.ai artifact
<https://claude.ai/artifact/8uqcGr2eNmzbQv8UVBshY2>. This folder is a backup of
it, so the page and its data can be used or rebuilt outside Claude.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `page.html` | The page source as published (version 12, 5 Oct 2026). |
| `data/items.json` | All 886 picks, keyed by id, as stored in the artifact's `items` collection. |
| `data/outfits.json` | All 140 outfits from the `outfits` collection. |
| `tools/fetch_photos.py` | Downloads listing photos and packs them for the page (step 2 below). |

The shared shortlist, Dave's thumbs and saved outfits (`saved`, `votes`,
`myfits`) are not copied here. They change from day to day and belong to the
people using the page.

---

## 1. Review of the current helper (before this round)

**Works well**
- Seven styles (Classic, Casual, Street, Minimal, Rave, Outdoors, Lounge). Each one has its own
  guidance on colours, what to wear, what to avoid and where to spend.
- Outfits are drawn on a figure of Dave, and each piece is numbered, priced and linked. Running
  totals show the saving against full price.
- The builder has slots, a colour for each piece and a "suggest under £X" search. The
  "one piece, many outfits" view shows cost per wear.
- The shortlist is shared and tracks what has been bought, and Dave's thumbs feed back into the
  ranking.
- The size data is honest: an "in his size" line where the shop shows stock, and his usual size
  where it doesn't.

**Gaps found**
1. **No product photos.** Every card was text only, and the drawings were the only visuals. The
   artifact sandbox blocks images from shop websites, so photos cannot simply be hotlinked. They
   have to be downloaded and published with the page.
2. **Shop coverage was uneven.** About 48 shops had picks, but nearly half the picks were from
   ASOS, M&S or Uniqlo. Many shops in the "Where to look" directory (Arket, COS, Gap, Joules,
   FatFace, Loake, Dr Martens, Gymshark, Decathlon and others) had no picks at all.
3. **No supermarket or value tier.** Tu, George and F&F are some of the best value for basics
   and knitwear, and none of them were covered.
4. **"New this week" is busy.** Over 200 picks carry `added: 2026-10-05`. That is right for a
   big refresh, but the weekly refresh should only set `added` on picks that are actually new, or
   the New filter stops meaning much.
5. **Sizes are still estimates.** The shirt collar and jacket chest are marked "to confirm". Until
   Dave is measured, "in his size" is only as good as the guess.
6. **Some pages are near their load limit.** Picks load as two queries of up to 1,000 each
   (clothes: 466, everything else: 315). That leaves room for about 500 more clothes picks before
   the split needs a third query.

## 2. Done in this round (5 Oct 2026)

- **Photo support in the page.** Each pick card now has a picture area at the top. Outfit rows,
  the builder list and the shortlist get a thumbnail for each piece.
  - The page shows the listing photo when one is stored: an item's `img` field, or an entry in a
    photo pack named by the `meta/photos` document.
  - When there is no photo, or a photo fails to load, the card shows a drawing of the garment in
    its colour.
  - Cards with a real photo are labelled "Shop photo", and the footer explains the difference.
- **36 new picks from 20 shops that had no picks before:** Arket, COS, Hawes & Curtis, Loake
  (factory outlet), Jean Store (Dr Martens), Seasalt, Decathlon, FatFace, Joules, Zalando (New
  Balance, BDG), Office (Vans), Gymshark, Tu at Sainsbury's, George at Asda, Rohan, Summits
  (Berghaus), White Stuff and Stuarts London (Timberland).
  - Picks span all seven styles, from a £9.99 Decathlon fleece to £169 Dr Martens.
  - Each pick has a real listing link and the date its price was seen. Some prices are from
    May to August, and the card shows that date.
- **11 new outfits**, mostly built from the new picks:
  - The supermarket upgrade, Coastal weekend, Three-in-one walk, Docs and black denim, Old Skool
    Saturday, Quarter-zip pub
  - Film night, Charcoal and navy, Wet weekend, Green cord and navy, and About £100, all new
- **"Where to look" directory:** grew from 89 to 104 shops. Two new groups were added:
  "Supermarkets and value" and "Big multi-brand shops". Counts now show for the new shops.
- Totals: **781 picks, 105 outfits, 66 shops with picks.**

## 2b. Done in round two (5 Oct 2026, later)

- **Shop filter** in Picks. It lists the shops with picks in the current style or search, busiest
  first, with counts.
- **Compact grid** toggle in Picks. It shows a denser grid with picture, name, price and shop,
  for browsing on a phone. Each viewer's choice is remembered on their own device.
- **Price-drop watch on the shortlist.** Saving a pick now stores its price, and the shortlist
  shows "Down £X since it was saved" when the price falls. This only covers picks saved from now
  on.
- **Old-price warning.** Cards whose price was last seen more than 30 days before the latest
  check say so, in amber, with "Check before buying".
- **13 more picks from 8 more shops:** Zara, The North Face, Peregrine, Mountain Warehouse,
  Converse, Foot Locker (New Balance 740), Sports Direct (£11 windbreaker) and END. (YMC), plus
  Next.
- **5 more outfits:** Black bomber, white tee; Made in England; Cold festival queue; Warehouse
  night under £100; Chucks and black denim.
- Totals: **794 picks, 110 outfits, 74 shops with picks.**

## 2c. Photos (5 Oct 2026, evening)

- Network access was opened, and `fetch_photos.py --browser` ran over every pick.
- **483 of 794 picks now show the shop's own listing photo** (version 8 of the page, two packs
  of about 3.9 MB in total, roughly 8 KB per photo).
  - Every Uniqlo pick has a photo, and 118 of 120 from M&S.
  - The photos also show as thumbnails in outfits, the builder, the shortlist, "This week" and
    "One piece, many outfits".
- **Still drawings:**
  - ASOS (195 picks): it stalls every connection from cloud servers.
  - Pre-owned searches: they have no single photo.
  - Picks linking to brand or category pages (most M and M Direct ones).
  - Shops that block even a headless browser: Arket, COS, Zara (mostly), Next, Joules,
    The North Face, Converse, Decathlon, Adidas, Office, Zalando, H&M, Hawes & Curtis,
    John Lewis and a few others.
- 42 photos that several picks shared were dropped, because a shared photo is a shop logo or
  banner rather than the product.
- To fill the gaps, run the tool from a home computer: shops rarely block home broadband the way
  they block cloud servers. Then republish the packs.

## 2d. Round three: live stock (5 Oct 2026, evening)

- With network access, picks now come straight from shops' own product feeds
  (`tools/shopify_pull.py` downloads a shop's whole catalogue). Each new pick has:
  - the live price and full price
  - **real stock in his size** (L, 34W 32L or UK 11)
  - the shop's own photo
- **49 new picks**, all in stock in his size when checked:
  - Jean Store: Levi's 501, 578 and 568, Lee, Stan Ray, Carhartt WIP, Fred Perry and
    Colorful Standard.
  - Community Clothing, Uskees, Brakeburn, Farah, Lyle & Scott, Peregrine, Base London, Savile Row
    Company, Montirex, Cernucci, Original Penguin and Route One.
  - New shops: Finisterre and Albam.
  - Most are 40 to 70% off.
- **10 new outfits** built on them: 501s and a chore jacket, Made in Britain knit, Baggy 578s and
  a coach jacket, Workwear weekend, Cold Saturday in cord, Black utility, Merino and derbies,
  Parka and checks, Navy bomber with ecru denim, and Sofa, brown and navy.
- Totals: **843 picks, 120 outfits, 76 shops; 532 picks with the shop's photo.**
- Shops whose feeds work, for the weekly refresh: Jean Store, Route One, Community Clothing,
  Uskees, Brakeburn, Cernucci, Montirex, Herring, Savile Row Company, T.M. Lewin, Fila, Summits,
  Albam, Sunspel, Finisterre, Colorful Standard, Base London, Farah, Original Penguin, Lyle & Scott,
  Peregrine and Oliver Spencer.

## 2e. Done in round four (5 Oct 2026, night)

- **Data fixes.**
  - The two dead M&S dressing-gown links now point to live gowns (Fleece Supersoft, midnight navy,
    £35, and Pure Cotton Polka Dot, navy, £35).
  - Five picks with no style got one.
  - Prices re-checked where the shop allows it: Seasalt, END. (YMC, now £74), White Stuff and
    Peregrine.
  - Three picks removed: two Gymshark links that are gone, and a Berghaus fleece that sold out.
    The outfit that used the fleece now uses a Stan Ray fleece.
- **Page (version 10).**
  - A pick can carry a fit tip (`sizeNote`), shown on its card, for example "Timberland boots
    run large: try a UK 10.5".
  - Saving a pick now also stores whether it was in his size. The shortlist says "Back in his
    size since it was saved" when that changes.
  - The "Where to look" directory now lists 117 shops.
- **46 new picks with photos and stock in his size**, from Universal Works, Solovair, Slam City
  Skates, Urban Industry, Hikerdelic, Folk, howies, Passenger, Alpkit and Montane (all new shops),
  plus Cernucci, Montirex, Original Penguin, Lyle & Scott and Uskees. Most of them are Street, Rave
  and Outdoor pieces, the styles with the fewest picks.
- **20 new outfits**, including a whole outfit for £57 (Under £60) and a smart one at about £150.
- **The Friday refresh** now adds the shop's photo to new picks (as `img`), sets fit tips, and
  checks the new shops' feeds.
- Totals: **886 picks, 140 outfits, 85 shops; 578 picks with a photo in the packs.**

## 2f. More photos (5 Oct 2026, late)

- ASOS blocks cloud servers, but the public image service wsrv.nl can still fetch its photos.
  The photo address is built from the product number and a colour code
  (`tools/asos_photos.py`).
  - This gave **176 of 195 ASOS picks** a photo.
  - Each one was checked by eye against the pick's name and colour.
- Next's image server answers directly, so both Next picks now have photos. So do Rohan's
  Range jeans and the New Balance 574s from Zalando.
- **758 of 886 picks now show the shop's photo** (page version 11, pack 5).
- Still drawings:
  - 19 ASOS picks whose colour code could not be found
  - 28 Vinted, eBay and Marrkt searches
  - 31 M and M Direct picks and a few M&S, H&M and John Lewis picks that link to a brand or
    category page rather than one product
  - About 35 picks from shops that hide their photos from every tool tried: Zara, COS,
    Arket, Decathlon, The North Face, WoolOvers, Schuh, Joules, Hawes & Curtis, Suit Direct
    and others
- Giving the M and M Direct picks single-product links would let them have photos too.

## 2g. Cheaper first and a sale section for each style (5 Oct 2026, evening)

- **Cheaper first.** In Picks, the recommended order is now half the curated rank and half
  price within each type, so cheaper picks rise without burying the best ones. Outfits do the
  same within each occasion. The builder's suggestions lean slightly towards pieces under £50.
- **A sale section for each style** ("Classic on sale", "Rave on sale" and so on), placed under
  the style intro:
  - It has its own advice and a list of the shops with the best sales for that style.
  - Counts show how many items are reduced, under £20, half price or more, and confirmed in his
    size.
  - Filters for type (the style's key types come first) and price (under £20, £40 or £75), and
    an "only in his size" switch.
  - It is sorted by best value, which weighs the reduction against the price, so a £12 tee at
    40% off sits above a £180 coat at 45% off. It can also sort by cheapest or biggest % off.
  - It shows 12 at a time, with a "Show more" button.
- **The Friday refresh** now aims for at least half of each week's new items under £40, at least
  three new reduced items under £25 per style, and an outfit under £60 where possible.
- Page version 12.

## 3. Next steps

### Step 1: Photos still missing
Most shops are done (see 2f). The gaps are shops that block cloud servers: 19 ASOS picks, Arket, COS,
Zara, Next, Joules, The North Face, Converse, Decathlon, Zalando, H&M, Hawes & Curtis, John
Lewis, Office and Gymshark. Running `python3 tools/fetch_photos.py --only <ids> --out photos`
from a home computer usually gets past them. Then add the new pack to the page and to
`meta/photos`.

### Step 2: Data hygiene (each weekly refresh)
- Re-check every pick whose `checked` date is over 30 days old: prices, links and his size.
  Remove dead links rather than leaving "No longer listed" gaps in outfits.
- Set `added` only on picks that are actually new (see gap 4), so "New this week" means
  something again.
- Store `img` (or refresh the packs) at the same time as the price check, so photos stay current
  with the listing.
- ~~Add a "price seen over a month ago" note to old cards.~~ Done in round two.

### Step 3: Fit and sizes
- Measure Dave: neck plus half an inch, chest under the arms, inside leg. Then update
  `meta/profile` and drop the "to confirm" notes.
- ~~Add a per-shop size note (`sizeNote`).~~ Done in round four. More can be added as fit tips
  turn up.

### Step 4: Page features worth adding
1. ~~**Photo-first view.**~~ Done in round two as the compact grid.
2. **Photo strip on outfit cards:** under the drawing, a row of the pieces' listing photos, once
   coverage is good.
3. ~~**Price-drop watch on the shortlist.**~~ Done in round two.
4. **"Shop by budget" quick sets:** an outfit for £60, £100 or £150, drawn from the builder's
   suggestion engine and refreshed weekly.
5. ~~**Shop filter in Picks.**~~ Done in round two.

### Step 5: More stores to add next
These are in the directory but still have no picks: Gap, Levi's, Dr Martens direct, Vans,
New Balance direct, Timberland direct, Berghaus direct, Urban Outfitters, Pull&Bear, Bershka,
TK Maxx, BrandAlley, Very and F&F. The search index had only old or US prices for Gap and Levi's
this round. Check them again when they can be reached directly. Next round: aim for 3 to 5 picks each, and favour sale stock and
pieces that slot into existing outfits.
